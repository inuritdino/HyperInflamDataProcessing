Diabetes

Paper: PNAS, 116(39):19619-19625.

"annotations.csv" was kindly provided by the Humphreys Lab.

Individiual control samples were processed as usual in Seurat.
See c1/c2/c3_Seurat1_readsINEX.rds

Similarly, the diabetes samples.
See d1/d2/d3_Seurat1_readsINEX.rds

Then the integration step was performed using Seurat v3 tools. Importantly
not all analyses can be replicated from the paper as they have used earlier
versions of Seurat. Where possible, parameters retained. Where not possible
Seurat suggestions used.

In the integrated object, only features found in all data sets and in our
databases were used (TF, LR, Signalling), since these are the features to keep.
However, the anchoring process involved only 1000 features (see anchor.features=1000 for
FindIntegrationAnchors function).

http://humphreyslab.com/SingleCell/ has everything and more, but download/access is not
granted.

Since there is no significant batch effects between the samples (Fig.S2), we could try
to avoid integration (simply, too big a dataset and Iris is still down:) ) by
simply clustering individual sets and then merging/concatenating the ready datasets.

Clusters will be assigned supervisedly (according to Fig.1B,D). This is mentioned
in the paper.
